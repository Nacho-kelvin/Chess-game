# Chess-game
 This Pygame chess app features a complete two-player experience with all standard rules. The clean interface displays a classic 8Ã—8 board with programmatically drawn pieces, eliminating image dependencies. Players click to move, with valid moves highlighted. The game enforces chess rules, including special moves like castling and en passant, while detecting checks and checkmates. A simple AI opponent provides solo play by making random legal moves. Designed for efficiency, the object-oriented code validates moves without exposing the king. Perfect for learning game development or chess programming, this lightweight project offers core functionality in under 500 lines. Developers can easily extend it with advanced AI or multiplayer features. A practical tool for studying both chess logic and Python implementation.
